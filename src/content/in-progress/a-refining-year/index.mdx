title: A Refining Year

It was about a year that I was away from dev work.
In the beginning of that stretch, I re-approached some personal projects I had in mind.
But something had changed. 
Software work felt daunting in a new way.
  
After 8 years of hardwork, I felt inadequate. 
  

But I recently learned that self-exposure is how you grow. So I leaned into my weakness.

_____


{/* dunning kruger  and checkboxes */}

Overwhelming, like I was slow, foolish, incapable.


{/*  */}


but even the thought of opening a coding editor my laptop felt repelant.


So once I had my living situation settled again, 


I finally gave my time therapy.


_____

I "on-boarded" to therapy with CBT via BetterHelp. 
CBT
_____

I found... a lot of frustrations with CBT...

I read, and read for a while. I watched people talk about the concepts on youtube, I watched lecturers, and read source texts.


P/A
Psychoanalysis was much more fruitful.

{/* I have had about a year off working. */}

I didn't expect to take this long, but I'm glad had some money saved.

Psychoanalysis ("The speaking cure"), is a form of talk therapy.
The process involves the client telling stories from their life, somewhat free associating, 
but in this "freedom" they're naturally guided by their tendencies toward and away from particular objects.
Not objects like "stapler" but objects like "intimate partnership", "satisfying work", "feelings of self-stability"..
So here, an "object" is a relation between a subject and a state of the world around them.


By setting a client free to speak, even without a clear task beyond "talk", they reveal themselves.

The analyst observes the scenes you describe. Observes how you seem to be charged by them, and how you're motivated by reaction to them.
They sometimes interject, and often let you continue speaking.


This patterning of communication forms "the talking cure".

Shame is like a fox trained to hunt itself. 

_____

In my family, I was trained to feel myself as the lowest element.

My father enjoyed mocking me in front of me.
He enjoyed having the cake and eating it: both mocking me to his audience (my mother, sister, anyone around),
and then looking back to me as though we have a united-front.

He'd hop back and forth between these postures as though there was no difference.
And for him, there wasn't. 
For him, sneering at his son, glancing to his audience, and heightening the show, flailing hands, laughing louder to cover any protesting noise or face I made.. 
He re-recruited the attention in this way...
Then looking back to me, he saw me as he saw his car buying clientele. Or his employees. 

He saw a customer that seemed to be dying in energy. So he'd feel in beat-like moment,
not a want for his son to enjoy his dinner, his home life and space, his family, his father, the moment, ...
instead he wanted this face and body which slumped before him, with eyes that locked him out... 
to be permissive and receptive to him.

So he'd seek new affiliation by whatever means necessary.

He'd turn back from his jeering, me feeling tense in my body, locked in.. and feeling I could really only look at Dad.
Looking to my family would invite the mockery of my sibling who'd learned from my father where they stand in relation me.

He'd turn back to me...
and put on a sweet voice and say things that meant nothing, "Oh, oh, T." To justifiably to put a little calming energy out.
Then he'd hop back to his laughter.

He'd start his sweet turn back to me with a direct gaze; a feigned loving parental posture he could strike for a moment.
Then, once he directly looked at me and successfully recruited my direct gaze back to him, he'd indirect his look. 
He'd stare right past me for a second or two and make mouth noises "hmhmmm, mmrm, WELL", and he'd launch into a story about himself.


______

I was what I call "gaze blind". I was taught routinely to ignore the meaning of gazes, of words being said, of demands on my body, space, time. 

I look back, and feel now that I was more like a body-part. Bound to my father by the act of his gaze.
_______



_____

letter to Paul.. being a flighty, worthless investment, taking up time and discourse space
letter to Nick..
letter to Dan... being... paranoiac, not taking direct confrontation, instead... building resentment... both fighting each other, and trying to move the project forward... but spending my time decompressing from work by yapping about it to my loved ones.. and becoming kindof person saying "He's petty! He's the problem!"

Jon
disconnecting uncertainties




hypercharging...

epistemological paranoia; epistemological charge

Jon disconnected my sense of Reality... or my ability to interpret reality.. 
using manipulation, charging.. not quite threats... 

____

Others need someone to disposition off of.... 
if you LEAD... you are then...  harvesting from that... instead of being the slave to others..

THE PROBLEM... my father raised me sadistically.

Jon ...

mentalization
______
______


simple..

As a kid, I had sleep paralysis nightly... for years.. from around 6 to 16.
The elementary school psychologist my parents took me to said I should get better quality sleep.
Dad laughed and was happy and her blindness to his obvious influence.

We went back home.

_____
Jon labeled me picky. But also routinely yelled "Yuck!" in disgust as mom handed me any food. 
He let mom take me to the dentist, let her tell me to brush my teeth, and let her alone shame me when I didn't.
I'm sure he passed shame along to her whenever my falling short came up. So she felt driven to pass off this force of driving shame to me.

I didn't like having cavities, or braces. But I didn't complain. (as I wasn't allowed to)

_____
Coming from this house, I didn't feel anything in my self.
I didn't have a "self".
I had a body and mind which would appear just as someone else's, 
but the weaving between the mind and body which occurs as you feel a breathe of joy or enthusiasm, 

My mind never had this space to breathe. 


_____
Coming from this house, I didn't understand human communication.
I didn't understand that people constantly use uncertainties and presentations to talk.

I believed the world worked on the level of patter.
Unsensed speech which isn't meant to be interpretted for it's Right or Wrongness, or it's Truth or Falsity..
but instead for its... ability to accrue attention, and get a rise from the Other. 

(now, really patter is also meant to guide the Other into a position of your choosing, like with sales, or narcissistic self-presentation)


So I lied, alot.

I lied like Holden Caulfield: bald-faced, blind to my own nakedness, ... 


And in this blindness to meaning, social dynamics, humanity... 
I began speaking as if I were hypersexual. Though, in my fear of others and complete naivete, I stayed roughly asexual.

But in way, it makes perfect sense:
If I'm completely blind/unattuned to the charge of the words and "objects" I'm wielding,
I get to freely wield highly-charged objects with no downside.
I'd get a massive rise out Others around me.



Coming from this house, I didn't understand gaze.
I didn't understand that if a girl looks at me, a boy, she's both just looking AND uncertainly/possibly signaling more. 
Signaling in justified and somewhat hidden surplus of the same beat of action, she may want to know about you. 
Looking at you is reading you.

I didn't feel that way. 
I could tell a girl was looking at me... 
I felt that if I was being looked at.... it meant nothing.
That I don't have access to privacy. I don't have access to conversational space.. 
I don't have access to free gaze.
And most of all...
there wasn't a person in my family who read my signals and reacted to them on my behalf, 
or who even reacted in a spirit of coherency.
 
Instead... my gaze was used against me. 
Information was read from me, and used for others contexts and processes. 

Others would see my needless self-defeating movements... 
clearly feeling myself worthless and outcast.
And amplify them.. my sibling would enjoy heightening my self-hate. Telling me my friends were horrible, weird, that I was greasy, ugly, weak.. a bad singer,


_____
When I played guitar for my parents for the first time... I think I was 16.
I had played since 10 or so.

Dad mocked me and said to "leash" that what I was doing looks impressive, but it's really easy
They sat 3 feet in front of me... 
me, not even beginning to find a posture to hold my guitar, not preparing to play, not .. 
just having to spend my full-mind and posture to hold myself still...

To bare the judgment/mockery/distraction etc.. until I could possibly get traction.

I deferred.
I deferred my wants for my space.

Until I was 30 or 31. 


Now, that sad man has no place in my life, except thoroughly dissected and mounted in a document.

_____
TRADEOFFS

oh... 
I'm getting high, and it's hittign me... 
that it's definitely the weed that's the issue...
both with my terminal inability to start... 
I've been working for a year on starting some dev projects.... I did actually start, and deliver some...
I just haven't given mself any credit.
I pushed the goalpost farther out so I didn't have to deal with success...

recognizing... I can't celebrate or succeed... 
if I don't have a coherent stretch of life and experience to feel that in.

before... that was because the breath of my attention was being robbed from me,
my space of mind...
ability to feel, a blooming experience which takes a second..
but around someone with persistent intention... persistent hunger for attention... 


And then I of course must have that pattern... 
like Courtney said, that she loves to give the kid who's asking for attention, the attention
I dismepowered myself to her as much as possible..
and could trust her.
I'm not sure if I loved her or not... cause I was so disembodied from myself...
I wrote poetry, but couldn't perceive gaze...
beyond where it pointed.. 
I had a persistently giving gaze. Non informational, by being constantly in the space of giving.
With a face that also says it's in reactive deferance to you.

These are the things we can drive and read on the Other.
