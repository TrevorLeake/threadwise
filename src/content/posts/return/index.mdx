Real page rent NYC ahrefs
etc..


vibe sampling... detecting when sociemo flow is about to shift. and joining


lighthouse
  DOM, CSSOM, canvas, vitals
  

synopses... 
- return to web fundamentals for blog and after nike web performance  
- return to web tools + spaces after therapy.. seeing my shame, stress, ego, unworkabiity 
- return to web fundamentals:
 (toward shopify and pragmatics)


palimpsest... 
introduction to a broad object tour...
and dev work.

{/* 
around my abilities... and fungibility
around my inabilities... long ignored fundamental patterns in my working, in my flow of attention, in my reaction to my feelings and thoughts; error Boundaries 

described as dual plane articles;; 
*/}
{/* 
be like... this is the dev surface;this is public facing me; theres more..;

around past jobs; the presentations I've accepted for myself; slipping standards; 
  reframing, smarting harvesting in of my positional blindness;


noticing.. I'm stressing mybodyand mind.. 
and often not eating..
(show... needed task, undone habitually, habitual somaticization of lack preoccupations with self and some form of avoidance ARE present)


article on Tamagachis; and Japanese cuteness by proxy?


.
.
the internet is young
I suffered successfully
I'm insight and full of things to say

meta markup site..
showing the residue everywhere...
possible path fromspectralism?

and what of ads and market capture...
emailing..
social media to catch people in the less internet savy space

how bout a switch between style and intent; instead of light and dark
super simple model;


rippling pond, koi fish
WebGL demo; 
graphics and integrated graphics check
strange expressive interaction flow 
handled well

and intentful -vs- styled switch




sketch book.. which is actually just imagesof my journal 
where I draw, or link ideas in chunks in 
quotient articles



odd article series; putting out a signal;

spectralism series; and rss basis; 
basically...



I need to setup my frontend 
backend,
responsive document serving mindset

and user acquisition + content output standards 


symbolic economy... 
impressions, expressions system.. 


I need a full modern toolchain for enabling 
this...

various signal outs ..
to particular audiences, not all blasting




____
could...

setup ci/cd; with test,prod
then have private sites..



and my unique aspects of sight and feeling throughout


but...
dev contractor mind... wants this fruit..
creating a fast modular megaphone for various audiences...
being valuable in the infrastructure of the web
integrations essentially
but great great great custom shop



_____
dev companion journal..
notice objects that go by that I don't go for..
then come back if they seem valuable, or let them fade

_____
topological hierarchy model... scss?
or react.. component fp logic reducer and children

playing with partitions 

or tree modeling ... 
react AST tree?

what if... addon with dev hotkey to pane out from the document, and observe the layers, render pattern in timeine, and tree.. all in native feeling hud instead of panes



calendar + tasks;; traversals...
recognizing..
- tasks are half rpresented.. objects in embeddings  flows and with aspect bundles
- configuration thickets..
- productive movement... 


sell something that makes workers see why they're slow...
and business runners and administrators understand the perspect they have


people , groups
like a bundle of fabric
computing in tension, finding freedom, and inability..



my planning...
if I really look at it...
is something like a series of feelings saying:
- I'm capable in dev
- I work hard and feel the drive
- (so I know it'll get done)

then I jump at the path in the way that feels right
and get high, lately. 
My standards slipped that far.
Which in the context of the rest of my life,
is understandable to me
But I also am sober now, firmly.


sketches of the thicket

okokok

here..
blog about... solidifying the layers.. 
using GPT in conversation around that
returning to dev
and good-bad of GPT; and the future

ALSO
with a stable basis... 
rss, ldjson, og, seo tags + structure, lighthouse scores, next

____

write on... how it's easy for computational cells to stray and blind... and then recast that tension against the Others
____


zizek says the gift bringing justifies it having been done
I think he's wrong
the gift bringing is a wise precomputation ; a reactive action to a sensed soon to arise circumstance; should I have brought a gift?

then zizek feels like a clever vulgar idiot,
reframing nothing into something to say (look at me)
but also
it finds Zizeks charged particle field.


puttingout a signal;

css; 
iterative sketch; person on laptop; mind reflcted in monad above; 
distributing site;

leveraging networks


some quick high imaginal algorithm sketches;
logs in a huge list; with some structure, some new components, 
some entries into a quotient article



- images on site;
- learning image use laws.. 
- and finding somthing for texture

notice... 
testing flows.. I said.. some guy almost ran me off the road
dad responded, he probably was in a rush; haha
just heightening, not caring, enjoying that he can take that position without me protesting..

feeling worthless.. 
and angry.. and confused.. and it being completely impossibel to place teh anger and exploitation on dad..
because he fills your real reificatory field..
vision, touch, proximity, speech, words, stomping, laughs, gaze, flicks of the posture
constantly something, more stimuli to keep you preoccupied.. 



what if... posts are leafs... and views are light pools..
or not..

no more weed...
Emily I think also made me feel safe.. and like I really am on track;
so with concrete proof, (really.. every synopsis a garland)
I know I can relax. I hold a object-self in mind like I am that.
I am immanently good still, now reparatively, I am on track-entitled to success.. and I'm forgiveably hurt..
but yeah, also 

tour through a garden; a garland

____
what if I start a self-economy;
local selves, establishing contract-promises;

not... Hey Trevor, lets try to behave with every principle and design principle in every core domain now..
then finding... I somewhat rightly rebel.. cause the effort I'm asking is immense even in small steps..
it's too much, I've tried many times.. 
but...
not quite sober enough, not quite emotionally unperturbed enough...

feedback looks like... your responsiveness in the moment of recognizing your're on the wrong path..

I see myself in my apartment alone again typing... 
and synopsizing this without the warm rich earthy coffee aroma, the ginger scone on the back of my tongue
and without the bodily sensations I feel.. so many to write and describe..



_____
sketcharticle..

I'm having a hard time finding a voice right now, 
so I'll start with some sketches.

- object intensity
- partitions 
- garland
- lattice
- affine sheaves
- comonad form

- monad movement
- justification
- superposition


_____


sketches of me lately.. as a streak. streak journal... building up sketch lib of beziers, dynamic coords, 

_____

algebraic geometry?

_____
blog..

show thinking in layers and projects as... one structure, harvesting value from a shimmering space.. evolving inversive fractal geometry;

first under multiple documents..
- design sketches; 
- dev-oriented maps (distribution|cache network quaities, ilities, ),  
- user-oriented paths, 
- resource lifecycle oriented, 


all sketches... or maybe affine images?...
or...

let me upload an element 


for em...
she uploads art; but with more assets than are available to the end owner.. individual svgs;
so.. then her art topics can tie together with her topics from other paintings 
in a new mixed juxtapose..
then each element becomes a portal to other works, as it is already, but reflected in the site..
and you make a few new buoquets or juxatpositions of elements..
maybe..


but this is the quotient journal for visual forms.
:)

_____


I am a pen; 
words are dried drives


_____
- quotient journal; visual, .. 


oh...
also..
imgs... 
and the reducibility of img space... camera matrix forms; and numbers as inversive (Real) lists 


___
public stance on haters: they're all correct; 
the most precious audience is the Hater;
for they sit and refine the world around you and want only to tell you what they see is true
they harvest in it, and they struggle with you and themselves and the world; just like you can.
Haters describe you; Like working form of a statue from block of marble, Haters describe you..
and reveal things you don't want to see, from angles you don't want to see.
But that's precisely where you should be looking...

I don't always feel this way, I always doubt this thinking at some point (I contain multitudes)
but 


oh, I'm Walt Whitman, Joe Rogan, Eve Sedgewick, Lacan and Delueze all as one.. fuck yes.
