chromium, firefox, ...

learning performance deeper.. : creating a site with shifty elements and by vitals



other eras of my coding... python, c++, c#, haskell

learning to love... constraint, opinionation, disappointment

  Things I feel I need to do...
  release an fast-modern website
  release a webapp (users, content with access controls, ..)
  release an app to mobile + web

learning the value of my work-time when my skin is in the game

learning to return to fundamentals


This site was built with...
- nextjs (framework)
- react (ui+state library)
- s3 + cloudfront (cdn)


_____
upcoming
the feeling of fighting React
the feeling of fighting CSS ; (realizing css is already uber powerful)

the values of constraint; lifts;

____
I've rethought...
what this job even is about... 
\{ 
  document distribution; typography and 
  symbols, (meaning)
  simulations; ledger keeping, 
  ...
  impressionality, expression, 
\}

the value of my time... the value of my labor, my mind, my skills
the fundamental value of a healthy body, healthy mind, healthy lifestyle, healthy relationship with self
