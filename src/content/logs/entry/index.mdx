I've been a multitude of things in the last year.

auth test finishing; detaskified

so...
today..
I got my /auth endpoint running (signup-in-out)
It's the first app I developed end to end with getting to prod in mind.

I got a smoke-testable version created and made a up-in-out flow on the frontend in next.
Both had me retracing some patterns I haven't looked at in a long time.
And on relooking, I saw my old/younger-self first encountering the same situation.

I was so averse to seeing my (inadequacy)/(newness to the space) when I was younger.

Now I'm practiced in it.-- Thank God --in seeing what I'm averse to seeing.

I hit all the same problems I never had solved before (and what else should I expect?)

But a sense of Wanting `prod`, having skin in the game, 
(being afraid of living in my car; needing a huge step into my own life for ...reasons)

it got my mind working anew. 
And my aversions to prod... have slowly lifted. :)

I put in place my smoke testing model, honestly, without that being the plan.
But not having made many trips from zero-to-prod; a nice way to say no trips... 
I just went where I knew how to get. A toy model.

Recently, software engineering as a field has been being reframed and reframed.
I've been seeing individual aspects in ways that never quite clicked-groked for me
I see now it's about making and tending impressions. Stable impressions.

But what is an "impression" ->> \{imaginality, legibility, impression - expression \}


As I took this sense onboard more intuitively...
the thought of giving an app or website to a person...
and knowing there are major pitfalls they could hit...  
or that they may not understand the point of the app
or that it may load slow..


I've always worked in a highly insulated position...
far from the user.

And blind. Did I mention. Somewhat blind to impression. Or particular aspects of impression.

{/* (3/5) aspect surface ratio estimations? then natural opening to numerology and expressive symbology  */}


intenful designs everywhere....
but so minimal
comments on youtube are just there... no sectioning structure.. 
just a big list of faces names and text and time; 
typography more important than visual structure


mini plan...
- [x] auth
  - [ ] playwright
  - [ ] getting to excellent standards and expanding for analytics;
- [ ] mailing + mailout test;
- [ ] sessions + playwright
- [ ] cdn out for next sites; and any site.
