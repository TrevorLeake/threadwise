As an engineer... 
I felt I couldn't just accept Wordpress, or Squarespace, or Wix, or
or Ghost, or Buttondown, or Substack...
or Medium, or, ...

And now, on the other side of a couple weeks of dev work.
I'm both disappointed and proud. :)
I feel strong and powerful, and foolish. 




Man...
I've been EXCITED about Dev lately. 
Thinking through what [integrations](/posts/the-configuration-thicket) are out there for easy use.


____
some todos...
- notice FOUC like flash with the scrollbar on a page-back command; if I scroll down to a link, click it to another article, page-back..
  seeing the page hop down, then rerender to the top... like it remembers the old page position
- wanting better understanding of my exposed SEO surface


- wanting... a new domain name for main blog... maybe
-              new domain for music and streaming... connected.. ? or hidden name..

- mdx plugin with intersubjective markup


_____
today... 
- article sketches in a workable clean space.. words first space... words as portals, no code..
- [ ] new env
- [ ] /auth + other integrations (ses; mailgun; posthog; ...)
- mailing + testing
- magic link flow

- jobs to target.. 

- [ ] test referrer headers on site... 
- [ ] test referrers incoming to site..
- [ ] test 


_____
what I need...
monads.. on video...
no spectrogram?
