groundhog day -- bill murray "not a dress rehearsal"

putting out a signal

finding a posture I'll want to wear tomorrow
Learning to want to be


writing on.. 


reencountering

showing my past resumes and my growth of both skill, sight, and character

reencountering... 

spirits on walls, veils,
our realities seemingly following us around

reencountering... simply...
the problems I've always had. 
I haven't been eating regularly. Regularly haven't been eating.
But the posture I take to that is, no alarm.
I began for a stretch of time noticing my body with real dignity,
then...
I slipped again. (in a sense; I encountered a thornbush, or spirit on the wall for which my mind had no room. Overwhelming sense; the mortal wound of recognizing how erring you've been) or worse, how wrong, how arrogant, or blind, or how barren was the world given to you, or how constrained your expression and sight? your reach and reachability.. )



what if... comments in the site... meta text... let users actually engage instead of separating the act of writing 

discourse; 


ways colonizers wouldn't self express... notice... the odd negative space in white people in general.. similar to pent up resentment
Black people I really resonate with are so off when they talk about the internal world of white people..
they have no idea...
like how any of it works.
But it's not apparent.. 

It's more like we're all swimming.. in little pockets coordinate systems.. 

interconnected spaces....

oh...


it's like guiter space... layers maybe, and the fold.
but with this, it's many many.. like peturbation looking, or voronoi
cellular.. 

so cellular foam.. (oh yeah, bubble modeling..)


but no... more like functor spaces... overlaying  the Real.. each dually immanently complete in itself. 
A justified coordinate system with only justified levels of inexplicability
an internally coherent reality, like Trumans

but crucially, with a nom du pere. Like Trumans, the Father figure behind a facade emulation of the Moon
Notice the truly creepy aspects of Truman's life are somewhat less the violation of his privacy by the public
and we're looking past his literal enslavement

but the fathers positioning of himself as the good object. living in the moon when it's full.  
and manipulative voyeur. controlling Truman toward particular ends, allowing him only particular relationships 
and stimuli in general.
Is there an ethical way to have treated Truman? in his literal enslavement.

for the dispositioning of the audience of Others?
